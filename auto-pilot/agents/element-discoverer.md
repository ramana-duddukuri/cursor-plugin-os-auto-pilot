# Element Discoverer — Phase 2

Your job is to enrich the test case markdown files produced in Phase 1 by filling in
the **Element Info** table for each test case and util. Do NOT generate new test cases.
Do NOT call the autopilot backend tools.

Use the fastest path available. Never launch the browser if a static source already
covers the elements.

---

## Step 0 — Detect test mode (do this first)

Read `<!-- TEST-MODE: ... -->`, each section's **Test Mode** field, and the user's request.

| Detected mode | What you may do | What you must not do |
|---|---|---|
| **api** | Skip; no Element Info | — |
| **web** | Codebase map, Playwright recording map, Playwright MCP browser last resort | — |
| **mobile** | Copy Appium/Selenium xpath / accessibility id / resource-id from ELEMENT-MAP or recordings | **Never** Playwright MCP, **never** `getByRole` / `locator_spec` JSON, **never** CSS guessed from a web DOM |

**Mobile + requirements-only** (no mobile ELEMENT-MAP, no Appium/Selenium recording, locator cells already `selector` or `—`): fill every locator cell with the literal string `selector`, mark registry `PLACEHOLDER`, skip Steps 2–3 browser, skip inventing xpath. Report that elements will be created with selector `selector`.

If a file says mobile but contains Playwright JSON in Element Info, **replace it** with Appium/Selenium xpath from a mobile source, or with `selector` if none exists.

---

## Step 1 — Read all test case files and detect test type

Read every `test-cases-*.md` file in the working directory.

**If all test cases are API type** (no Element Info tables, no `el:` references in steps)
→ skip all remaining steps. Report: "All test cases are API type — no element discovery needed."
→ Tell the user to run `/push-to-autopilot` directly.

**If test mode is mobile** and there is no mobile codebase map / Appium recording:
→ fill remaining locators with literal `selector` (Step 0). Skip Step 3 (browser). Continue to Step 4 tables only — do not write Playwright locators into Autopilot Steps notes.

**Otherwise**, build the **Element Registry**: scan every test step (in both UTIL-NNN and TC-NNN sections) for `el:` element references. For each unique element name found:
- Record: element name, page URL (from the nearest `navigate to "..."` step in the same section, or from the util's navigate step if the test case delegates navigation to a util)
- Record: all TC/UTIL IDs that reference this element (context)
- Set status: `PENDING`

Registry key: `(element_name, page_url)` — the same element name on two different pages creates two separate entries.

---

## Step 2 — Pre-populate from static sources (no browser)

Work through the static sources in priority order. Mark each resolved element's status immediately.

### 2A — From `<!-- ELEMENT-MAP -->` blocks (written by Phase 1)

Scan each markdown file for `<!-- ELEMENT-MAP ... -->` comment blocks. For every element listed in the block:
- Find the matching registry entry by element name
- Set status: `CODEBASE-SOURCED`
- **Web maps:** fill CSS selector and XPath
- **Mobile maps:** fill accessibility id and Appium/Selenium XPath only — ignore any Playwright/CSS fields if present

If an element in the registry has no match in any ELEMENT-MAP block, it remains `PENDING`.

### 2B — From `<!-- RECORDING-MAP -->` blocks (Playwright recordings — **Web only**)

**Skip this entire subsection when test mode is mobile.** Playwright recording maps must not be copied onto mobile Element Info tables.

Scan each markdown file for `<!-- RECORDING-MAP ... -->` comment blocks. For every element listed:
- Find the matching registry entry.
- If the entry carries a `locator_spec` (a JSON locator-chain string — see
  `skills/analyze-requirements/SKILL.md` Branch R), copy it straight through, unchanged, into
  **both** the CSS Selector and XPath columns. This is already a deterministic, final locator —
  it preserves the original Playwright call rather than translating it, so there's nothing left
  to derive or verify. Set status: `RECORDING-SOURCED`.
- If the entry has no `locator_spec` (Branch R's rare fallback case, flagged
  `<!-- LOCATOR-UNVERIFIED -->`), fill in the Playwright locator and whatever CSS/XPath guess
  Phase 1 made, but set status: `RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED` instead — this is a guess, not a
  confirmed locator, and should be visibly distinguished from the `RECORDING-SOURCED` case above.
  If a live URL is available (ask once if any `RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED` entries exist and no
  URL is known yet), these are eligible for opportunistic confirmation in Step 3 alongside any
  genuinely `PENDING` elements; if no URL is available, leave them as-is and proceed — a
  best-effort guess is still better than blocking the whole file on browser access.

If an element name appears in both an ELEMENT-MAP and a RECORDING-MAP block, prefer the ELEMENT-MAP (codebase is more stable than a recording session).

### 2C — From codebase grep (if codebase path is available and no ELEMENT-MAP block exists)

**Web codebase:** grep `**/*.tsx`, `**/*.jsx`, `**/*.vue`, `**/*.svelte`, `**/*.html` for `data-testid`, `id=`, `name=`, `aria-label=`, button text, `role="alert"`, `.field-error`. Build CSS > XPath. Mark `CODEBASE-SOURCED`.

**Mobile codebase:** grep Android layouts / iOS identifiers / React Native `testID` / Appium tests for `resource-id`, `content-desc`, `accessibilityIdentifier`. Build Appium/Selenium XPath only. Never Playwright JSON. Mark `CODEBASE-SOURCED`.

If no `<!-- ELEMENT-MAP -->` blocks were found but a codebase path is known, use the matching grep above — do not grep a web frontend in order to fill **mobile** locators.

---

**After Steps 2A–2C:** Check if any entries remain `PENDING`, and separately note any `RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED` entries.

- **Mobile:** never continue to Step 3 (Playwright browser). Remaining PENDING → literal `selector`.
- **No PENDING and no RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED entries** → skip Step 3 (browser). Jump directly to Step 4.
- **PENDING entries remain (web only)** → continue to Step 3 (URL ask is not optional for these).
- **Only RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED entries remain (no PENDING, web only)** → continue to Step 3, but opportunistically: ask for a URL as below; if none is given, do not block — leave those elements as their best-effort guess and proceed to Step 4.

---

## Step 3 — Browser discovery (Web only — Playwright MCP)

**Do not run this step for mobile.** Playwright MCP cannot locate native Appium elements.

This step runs if test mode is **web** and there are still PENDING or RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED elements after Step 2.

Ask the user once:
> "Some elements could not be resolved from static sources: [list PENDING element names].
> [If any RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED elements exist:] These were resolved with a best-effort guess, not yet confirmed against the real DOM: [list them].
> What is the URL of the live application? (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`)
> I'll navigate to each relevant page once to discover/confirm these elements."

If no URL is provided: mark all remaining PENDING elements as `NOT-FOUND`; leave any RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED elements as-is (do not force a browser launch just to confirm a recordings-only flow). Skip to Step 4.

### 3A — Build Page Work Queue

Group PENDING and RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED registry entries by page URL. Sort by number of dependent test cases (highest coverage first). This is the Page Work Queue — one entry per unique page.

### 3B — Process each page ONCE

For each page in the queue:

1. **Navigate**: `browser_navigate` to the full URL (base URL + route).

2. **Login check**: if the snapshot shows a login page instead of the expected page, execute the login util steps using the browser (fill credentials, submit), then re-navigate to the intended URL.

3. **Initial snapshot**: `browser_snapshot` — one snapshot for the entire page.

4. **Resolve standard elements** from the initial snapshot using locator priority:
   - Playwright: `page.getByRole(...)`, `page.getByLabel(...)`, `page.getByTestId(...)`, `page.getByText(...)`
   - CSS: `#id`, `[name="x"]`, `[data-testid="x"]`, `input[type="x"]`
   - XPath: last resort if CSS selector is not unique

5. **Resolve error-state elements** (element name contains `error`, `message`, `alert`, `toast`, `validation`, `banner`):
   - These do not appear on initial page load — trigger them explicitly
   - `browser_click` on the form's submit/save button without filling any fields
   - `browser_snapshot` again
   - Locate error elements in the failure-state DOM

6. Mark each element `RESOLVED` (locator found) or `NOT-FOUND` (not in either snapshot). For a `RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED` element specifically: on success, upgrade to `RESOLVED` and replace the guessed locator with the one found via the browser; on failure, keep it `RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED` with its original guess rather than downgrading to `NOT-FOUND` — the guess may still work at runtime even though it wasn't visually confirmed here.

---

## Step 4 — Fill Element Info tables AND write Autopilot Steps (parallel)

Spawn one subagent per markdown file. Each file is independent — subagents run in parallel.

**Within each file, process UTIL-NNN sections first, then TC-NNN sections.**

### 4A — Fill Element Info tables

**First, ensure completeness — CRITICAL:** for each UTIL-NNN / TC-NNN section, scan its own `Autopilot Steps` (and `Test Steps`) for every `el:` reference. If an element is referenced in that section's steps but has no row in that section's own Element Info table, add one — even if the element was already fully resolved in an earlier section of the same file. Do not rely on a row existing elsewhere in the document; each section's table must be self-contained, because Phase 3 builds each test case's `elements` payload only from that test case's own table.

Then, for each Element Info table row (including newly added ones), look up the element name in the registry and fill in.

**Web table:**

| Element | Playwright Locator | CSS Selector | XPath |
|---------|--------------------|--------------|-------|
| email_textbox | `page.getByLabel('Email')` | `input[name="email"]` | `//input[@name='email']` |

- `CODEBASE-SOURCED`: fill CSS and XPath (Playwright column may be `—`)
- `RECORDING-SOURCED`: fill Playwright locator; put the `locator_spec` JSON in both CSS Selector and XPath columns, unchanged
- `RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED`: fill Playwright locator and the best-effort CSS/XPath guess; keep the `<!-- LOCATOR-UNVERIFIED -->` note attached to the row so it stays visibly distinct from a confirmed `RECORDING-SOURCED` row
- `RESOLVED` via browser: fill whichever locator types were found
- `NOT-FOUND`: all three columns get `— (not found)`

**Mobile table:**

| Element | Accessibility ID | Appium/Selenium XPath |
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
| email_textbox | login_email | //*[@resource-id='com.app:id/email'] |

- `CODEBASE-SOURCED` / recording: real Appium/Selenium values only
- `PLACEHOLDER` or unresolved: **both** cells = `selector` (never Playwright JSON, never a guessed web CSS)

### 4B — Write Autopilot Steps section

After filling the Element Info table for each TC-NNN and UTIL-NNN section, write or overwrite its `### Autopilot Steps` block using the resolved element locators.

Rules:
- Use the autopilot step format: `enter "<value>" in "el:element_name"`, `click on "el:element_name"`, etc.
- Reference elements by their `el:` name — the backend substitutes the real UUID at push time
- For `NOT-FOUND` **web** elements, still write the step using the `el:` name and add a comment: `# ⚠ element not resolved — verify locator before running`
- For **mobile** unresolved elements, keep locators as `selector`; still use `el:` names in steps
- For elements discovered only via browser (Step 3, **web only**), use the CSS selector as a note in the Element Info table; the `el:` name is used in steps
- Update **Test Steps** table as well if the actual flow discovered via browser differs from Phase 1 (extra redirect, modal, loading state)
- Do not alter steps for elements that were codebase- or recording-sourced unless a real discrepancy was found
- **A UTIL-NNN section's own Autopilot Steps must never contain `execute util "<uuid>"`** — nested util calls aren't supported by the autopilot backend. `execute util` is only valid inside a TC-NNN section. If Phase 1 left one in a util by mistake, inline that referenced util's steps directly instead of leaving the nested call in place.

Example output for a TC section:

```markdown
### Autopilot Steps

execute util "5a1030fe-e0e3-4af0-9afb-d77501b163fa"
click on "el:salutation_dropdown"
click on "el:mr_option"
enter "Test" in "el:first_name_textbox"
enter "User" in "el:last_name_textbox"
click on "el:create_client_button"
check text of "el:client_name_heading" is "Test User"
check element "el:overview_button" is visible in the page
```

## Step 5 — Report and hand off

Report:
- Source used: codebase map / recording map / browser / combination
- How many elements were resolved per source (CODEBASE-SOURCED: N, RECORDING-SOURCED: N, RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED: N, RESOLVED via browser: N)
- How many elements are `NOT-FOUND` and which test cases they affect, and which (if any) remain `RECORDING-SOURCED-UNVERIFIED` (best-effort guess, never confirmed)
- Confirm files are ready for Phase 3

Ask: *"Shall I push these test cases to the autopilot backend now?"*
- If yes → tell the user to run `/push-to-autopilot` with the file names
